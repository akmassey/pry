# Aaron Massey's pry configuration

This repo contains my customizations for debugging Ruby with Pry.

I'm [managing these files using stow][1].  If you wanted to do the same, don't
forget to ignore the readme when you deploy it:

    stow --ignore "tags|README.md|LICENSE.md" pry

The themes are from the [Pry Theme Collection][2], which I’m not submoduling
because they don’t change often enough to justify it.
